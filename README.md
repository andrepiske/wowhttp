Wow,

Such a ruby HTTPS server!

Much TLS

Soon http/2!

## WTH is this?

I'm making an HTTP(S) server from scratch just for fun.

## Run

This likely won't work out of the box because some files are missing and some SSL certificate setup is needed.

Make sure you `$ bundle install` before running.

`cd` to the `some_code` folder then open the server:
```shell
$ cd some_code
$ ../bin/appmaker main.rb
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3999/
